# CellularAutomata
codes utilizing cellular automata methods

<p> SimpleFire.m is a simple wildfire spreading model using cellular automata (CA). It is literally the simplest model I could possibly build, but in doing so I have learned a lot about the framework of CA modeling which I think will help me in making more complex CA models in the future, likely using Cell Lab. </p>
